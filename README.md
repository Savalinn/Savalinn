<pre>
Svalinn heitir,
hann stendr sólu fyrir,
skjöldr, skínanda goði;
björg ok brim,
ek veit, at brenna skulu,
ef hann fellr í frá.
- Grímnismál 38,
Guðni Jónsson's edition

<pre>
Svalinn is his name,
he stands a shield before the sun,
the shining deity.
I know that the hills and
the sea would burn,
if it were to fall from its place.
- Grímnismál 38,
William Herbert's translation
